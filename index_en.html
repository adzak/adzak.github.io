                    <p class="lead">In February 2019 I will take my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and Economics at KTH Royal Institutue of Technology. I am super excited to show what I got and to become an awesome software engineer!</p>
                    <p class="lead">The computer has been my main tool to create things. This often takes the form of coding applications that me and my friends can use. </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                    I prefer to do many things at once. I think it's a fun challenge to create an overview of what to to priorotize and because I get bored when I don't have things to do. I therefore try to work at projects and do activities. The project I am working at currently is my degree project. This project is about coding a mobile application that is supposed to motivate the user to save money in a simple and fun way.</p>
                    <p class="lead">If anything you read sounds interesting don't hesitate to contact me :) <p>

                    <p>BlueBear was a website which could generate a slideshow of pictures from Instagram. The user could input a tag and the website fetched images from Instagram with that tag. The user had the ability to choose which pictures which were to be included in the slideshow. BlueBear was meant to be used at events to give event goers an interactive experience. I had several tasks in this project, but the main component I worked on was a filtering system. This filtering system could prevent images with inappropriate character, such as offensive symbols and nudity. The filtering system was coded in PHP.</p>
